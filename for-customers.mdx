### Setting Your Budget and Finding Best Value

We have developed a powerful AI tool to help you efficiently find items for specific purposes
while saving both time and money. With our tool, you can:

- **Find the Right Items for Your Activity**: Whether you&#39;re organizing a graduation party,
  gardening, building a fence, moving to a new apartment, staging an apartment for sale,
  planning a skiing trip, or preparing for a family summer trip, Rentiqe makes it easy.
  Simply choose from several pre-made activities, and the system will find all the items
  you need for that activity—based on availability, dates, and location.

  - For example, if you&#39;re organizing a **graduation party**, the budget tool will provide
    suggestions such as tables, chairs, a sound system, decorations, and lighting.
    This ensures you don&#39;t miss any important items and saves time by providing
    everything you need in one place.
  - If you&#39;re planning a **gardening project**, the system can help you find tools like
    shovels, rakes, wheelbarrows, and even lawn mowers, making it more cost-
    effective than purchasing these items individually.
  - For a **skiing trip**, you can find ski equipment, winter clothing, and
    accessories—all from multiple renters, ensuring you get the best deals without
    having to search different rental shops.
  - **Staging an apartment** for sale? The budget tool will help you find furniture,
    decor items, and other accessories that will make your space more appealing to
    buyers—all without the need to buy items you won&#39;t need afterward.
  - If you are **moving to a new apartment**, the tool can help you find moving
    equipment like dollies, packing supplies, and even a van for transporting your
    items—all from local renters, making your move much more convenient and
    affordable.

- **Get Smart Recommendations**: Our tool not only finds the items you searched for but
  also suggests related items that you may not have thought of but are crucial for your
  chosen activity. This feature helps ensure you have everything you need without the
  hassle of researching each item individually.
- **Save Time by Aggregating Renters**: The items are gathered from multiple renters,
  which means you can instantly see the best options available without needing to explore
  different rental sources. This saves you a lot of time and ensures that you find the best
  deals all in one place.

With our budget tool, you can maximize the value of your rental budget, explore cost-effective
bundles, and make better decisions—renting everything you need for less, instead of buying
expensive items that you may only use occasionally.

### Adding Items to Your Rental Cart

Adding items to your rental cart on Rentiqe is designed to be flexible and user-friendly. The
rental cart includes both individual items and entire events or activities that you want to plan,
making it much more advanced than a traditional e-commerce cart.

- **Rental Cart with Dates**: One of the key features of Rentiqe is our ability to support
  items with specific rental dates. Unlike standard e-commerce platforms that only handle
  quantities, our rental cart accommodates different dates and quantities, allowing you to
  manage your rentals seamlessly. For example, you can add a set of tools for a
  gardening project on one specific date, while also adding items for a Christmas party on
  a completely different date—all within the same cart.
- **Activities and Events**: You can also add pre-defined activities or events to your rental
  cart. For instance, if you&#39;re planning a graduation party, simply select the activity, and
  our system will add all the necessary items to your rental cart for that date and location.
  This feature saves time and helps ensure that nothing is forgotten.
- **Flexible and Convenient**: Whether you&#39;re renting items for one date or planning
  multiple activities at different times, Rentiqe makes it easy to keep everything organized.
  This flexibility helps you save time and money, as it consolidates items from different
  renters into a single, convenient booking process.

Our rental cart system makes it effortless to manage complex rentals, ensuring you have
everything you need when you need it, without the hassle of navigating multiple bookings.

### Understanding Availability and Pricing

Availability and pricing are essential aspects of Rentiqe, ensuring that you have accurate
information to make the best decisions for your rental needs.

- **Up-to-Date Availability**: All listed items on Rentiqe feature an availability calendar that
  is constantly updated, so you always know if an item is available for your desired dates.
  This feature eliminates uncertainty and helps you plan effectively without the risk of
  double-booking or unavailable items.
- **Transparent Pricing**: Our pricing is fully transparent, meaning there are no hidden fees
  or surprises. You can see the exact cost of renting each item, including any discounts for
  longer rental periods or additional costs for services like delivery or installation.
- **Convenience of Availability and Pricing Information**: By checking the availability
  calendar and transparent pricing upfront, you can make informed decisions quickly and
  efficiently. For example, if you are planning a big event like a graduation party or a family
  trip, knowing the exact dates and costs of each item helps you stick to your budget and
  avoid last-minute issues.

Rentiqe&#39;s focus on clear availability and pricing saves you both time and money, making it
easier to find exactly what you need, when you need it, at a price that works for you.
