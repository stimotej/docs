<Accordion title="How does identity verification work?">
  Rentiqe works with [Stripe](https://stripe.com/) to conduct identity verification online. Stripe builds technology that’s used by millions of companies around the world such as Amazon, Google, and Zoom. Stripe helps with everything from accepting payments to managing [subscriptions](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/creating) to verifying identities.

Stripe helps Rentiqe confirm your identity by conducting the following checks:

1. Stripe captures images of the front and back of your government-issued photo ID and reviews it to make sure that the document is authentic. They’ve built an automated identity verification technology that looks for patterns to help determine if an ID document is real or fake. This process is like a bank teller checking your ID document to confirm that it’s real.

2. Stripe captures photos of your face and reviews them to confirm that the photo ID belongs to you. It has built automated identity verification technology that uses distinctive physiological characteristics of your face (known as [biometric identifiers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biometrics)) to match the photos of your face with the photo on the ID document. This process is similar to a bank teller confirming that the photo on your ID document is you based on your appearance – but it’s a higher-tech and more accurate way to identify you as a unique person.

3. Stripe collects your name, date of birth, and government ID number, and validates that it’s real. They’ll check this information against a global set of databases to confirm that it exists.

Stripe asks for your consent before collecting and using your biometric information. It’ll only use your verification data in accordance with the [permissions](https://supportstripe.com/questions/common-questions-about-stripe-identity#verification-permissions) you grant before starting the verification process, and based on its [Privacy Policy](https://rentiqe.com/legal/privacy-policy).

<Accordion title="What are the best practices for successful verification?">
Before starting the verification process, here’s what you need:

* A valid government-issued photo ID document. Not a photocopy or a picture of an ID document. Make sure that the ID document hasn’t expired.
* A device with a camera – use a mobile device if possible. Cameras on mobile devices typically take higher-quality photos than a webcam.

The quality of the images you capture affects success rates dramatically. Below are a few best practices to help make sure that your verification succeeds:

* Capture a clear image. Make sure that the images aren’t too dark or bright, and don’t have a glare. Hold steady and allow your camera to focus to avoid blurry photos.
* Don’t block any part of your ID document in the image. Ideally you should lay it flat to take the photo.
* Don’t block any part of your face. Remove sunglasses, masks, or other accessories.
* Find a location with ambient lighting. Avoid spaces with strong overhead lights that cast a shadow on your face or ID document. Avoid sitting directly in front of a bright light which can wash out your face and add a glare to your ID document.
