### Creating Your Store on Rentiqe

Whether you have items you rarely use or want to start a rental business, creating a store on
Rentiqe is easy. Click on “Create Store” from your account dashboard to get started.

- **Store Name**: Start by entering a store name. The store URL will be formed as
  `rentiqe.com/store-name`, and you can edit this later if needed. Creating a store is simple,
  and your store will be set up as soon as you enter the name.
- **Managing Your Store**: Once your store is created, you can manage it by adding items
  for rent. We encourage you to personalize your store page by adding a store image, a
  detailed description, and links to your website or social media platforms. This helps build
  trust and attract more customers.
- **Customer Experience**: On your store page, customers can easily find and filter your
  items by using the search bar or by browsing through different categories. Stores have
  ratings and reviews from users, which help build credibility. The more reliable your store
  is, the more likely customers will be to rent from you.
- **Automation and Inventory Management**: Rentiqe helps you automate the entire rental
  process. You can easily manage your items, their availability, and bookings using a
  state-of-the-art calendar that is user-friendly and easy to navigate. You can also track
  order details and communicate directly with customers through the platform.
- **Billing and Invoicing**: Invoices are automatically generated through the platform. To
  make this process seamless, simply enter your billing information, such as company
  name, address, and VAT number. This ensures that invoices are automatically created
  for each transaction.
- **Payouts**: Payouts are made automatically to your selected bank account after
  completing the verification process. This means you get paid promptly and securely for
  your rentals.
- **Warehouse Management**: You can manage inventory across multiple warehouses.
  Warehouses represent different locations where your rental items are stored. For
  example, if you have items in both Zagreb and Split, you can create separate
  warehouses for each location and manage the quantities available in each. This helps
  you optimize availability and better serve customers in different areas.
- **Team Members and Roles**: Stores can have multiple members who can be easily
  added and managed through the dashboard. Members can have different roles with
  specific permissions:
  - **Administrator**: Full access to manage the store, add or edit items, handle
    bookings, and manage payouts and billing information.
  - **Manager**: Can add and edit items, manage bookings, and communicate with
    customers but does not have access to billing or payouts.
  - **Assistant**: Can manage bookings and communicate with customers but cannot
    add items or access billing and payouts.

By leveraging these features, you can create a successful rental store on Rentiqe, streamline
your operations, and reach more customers effectively.

### Listing an Item for Rent

Click on “Add Item” and follow these steps:

- **Category**: Select the appropriate category for your item.
- **Name**: Provide a name for the item.
- **Description**: Describe your item. You can also use AI to help generate a detailed
  description.
- **Quantity**: Specify the quantity available. You can add one or several warehouses where
  this item is available, and for each warehouse, set up the available quantity.
- **Extras**: Decide if you want to offer additional services:

  - **Delivery**: You can choose to offer delivery of the item. Specify the price and the distance covered (e.g., 10 euros for a 10 km distance). You can add multiple distance options with different prices.

    - “I want to offer delivery. I will deliver the product to the customer and pick it up when the rental is finished.”

  - **Installation**: Offer installation services for the item. Define the price for installation (e.g., setting up a tent can be 10 euros, and dismantling it can be 5 euros).
    - “I want to offer installation. I will install the product for the customer.”
  - **Add-ons**: Offer additional services or products with your item. These can be
    additional items that are rented or bundled with the main item. For example, an
    additional joystick with a PS5 console or a bundle of a TV with a PlayStation. If
    renting a PlayStation costs 25 euros per day and a TV costs 20 euros, the bundle
    can be offered for 35 euros per day.

- **Price**: Set the rental price for the item.

  #### Setting Prices and Availability

  - **Daily Price**: Set the daily rental price for the item.
  - **Total Value**: Enter the total value of the item.
  - **Minimum Rental** Period: Define the minimum rental period for the item.
  - **Discounts for Longer Rentals**: Create discounts for longer rental periods by
    adding the number of days and specifying the discount for that period.
    - Example: If the daily price is 10 euros, you could offer a 10% discount for
      rentals of 7 days or more.

Make sure to update the availability calendar regularly to avoid scheduling issues.

- **Security Deposit**: Define the security deposit required.
  You have four options for setting a security deposit for your items:
  - **Do Not Charge a Security Deposit**: You can choose not to charge a security
    deposit at all, making it easier for customers to rent your item without upfront
    additional costs.
  - **Booking Amount**: Charge a percentage of the total booking amount. For
    example, you can set a 20% security deposit based on the overall rental fee,
    providing some assurance for potential damages.
  - **Product Value**: Charge a percentage of the product&#39;s total value. This option is
    useful for higher-value items where the deposit is proportional to the risk
    associated with renting the item.
  - **Fixed Amount**: Charge a fixed amount as a security deposit. This can be a set
    value, such as 50 euros, regardless of the rental price or the item&#39;s value.

Choose the option that best suits your needs and the value of the item being rented.

- **Images**: Upload images to help showcase the item.

  Great images and clear descriptions help your items get rented.

  - **Minimum of 3 Pictures**: Make sure to upload at least 3 images of your item.
    Images can be in any standard format (e.g., JPG, PNG). The more high-quality
    images you provide, the more likely users are to feel confident in renting your
    item.
  - **Tips for Taking Pictures**: Use a well-lit environment and take photos from
    multiple angles to give renters a clear understanding of what they are getting.
    Include close-up shots of important features or accessories. Better pictures
    significantly improve the chances of renting, as they help build trust and provide
    more details to potential customers.
