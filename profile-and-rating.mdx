Rentiqe places a strong emphasis on transparency and trust within the community. Each
individual user and store has its own profile featuring reviews, ratings, and rental history. This
includes:

- **Individual Profiles**: Users have profiles that show their rental history, ratings, and
  reviews from stores. The more positive reviews and completed rentals a user has, the
  more trusted they become within the community. For example, a user with a history of
  multiple successful rentals and positive feedback from stores will be more likely to be
  trusted by new renters.
- **Store Reviews and Ratings**: Stores are rated based on the quality of their items,
  customer service, and reliability. Customers can leave detailed reviews that help others
  make informed decisions. For instance, if a store consistently provides clean and well-
  maintained camping gear, its high rating will attract more customers. Store ratings are
  crucial for building credibility and trust, encouraging renters to provide excellent service.
- **Item Ratings**: Each item listed for rent can receive ratings and reviews. This feature
  helps ensure that customers know the exact condition and quality of the items they are
  renting. For instance, an item like a bike might have reviews that mention its condition,
  ease of use, and any accessories included, helping future renters make well-informed
  decisions.

These features are vital to the platform&#39;s success, helping create a community of reliable renters
and satisfied customers. Ratings and reviews allow users to make better choices, increasing
trust and satisfaction for everyone involved. A well-reviewed store, reliable users, and highly-
rated items all contribute to a positive rental experience, which in turn helps the Rentiqe
community grow and thrive.
