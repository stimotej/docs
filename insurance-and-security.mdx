Each store on Rentiqe has its own security and item policy to protect both renters and
customers. Additionally, Rentiqe insures the items listed on the platform, creating a shared
responsibility and commitment from all involved parties. As long as the platform&#39;s rules are
followed, Rentiqe serves as a safeguard for both sides by insuring items and ensuring smooth
transactions.

- **Store Security Policies**: Each store on Rentiqe can set its own security policies, which
  may include specific rules or requirements for renting items. For example, a store may
  require a security deposit or enforce conditions for proper use of equipment.
- **Platform-Wide Insurance**: Rentiqe provides insurance coverage for items rented
  through the platform. This means that if any unforeseen issues occur, such as damage
  or theft, Rentiqe steps in to provide compensation, as long as all rules have been
  followed. This shared responsibility between renters, customers, and Rentiqe helps
  ensure that everyone involved is protected. For instance, if a rented item like a high-
  value power tool is damaged during the rental period, Rentiqe&#39;s insurance can help
  cover repair costs, giving peace of mind to both the renter and the customer.
- **Shared Responsibility**: All parties—renters, customers, and Rentiqe—play a role in
  ensuring the security of transactions. Renters are expected to provide accurate
  information about their items, while customers are responsible for using items properly.
  Rentiqe supports both sides by offering insurance, dispute resolution, and support,
  ensuring that every rental is as smooth and secure as possible.
