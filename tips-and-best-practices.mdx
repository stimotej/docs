How to Make the Most of Your Budget

Renting bundles of items instead of purchasing individual tools or equipment helps save money
and reduces unnecessary spending on items youâ€™ll rarely use.

**Tips for Listing Your Items Effectively**  
Good photos, detailed descriptions, and a competitive price are key to attracting more
